# Responsive Figma-to-HTML Website

This is my first web project — a fully responsive website built with **vanilla HTML and CSS**, based on a Figma design.  
The focus was on **design accuracy, responsiveness, and layout fundamentals** (without frameworks or libraries).

## Features

- ✅ Fully responsive
- ✅ Pixel-perfect implementation of a Figma design
- ✅ Built entirely with HTML & CSS (no frameworks, no JavaScript)  
- ✅ Clean layout and visual consistency
